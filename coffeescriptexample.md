# Coffee Script

### Reasons I like CS

- Feels like writing ruby on the front-end
- Compiles to pretty JavaScript
- Helps you write code faster
- Plays nice with rails and angular

### Some of the Basics

- No more curly braces, no more semi-colons, and way less parenthesis. 
- Writing functions (as function expressions) with '->'
-- Example: 
-- JS: 
```
var funName = function() {
  return 'This is a function!';
}
```

-- CS:
``` 
funName = ->
  'This is a function'
```
